        <center style="color: aliceblue;">Abstract</center>
        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the neuro development disorder. It effects on how the people communicate and interact with others. In this we particularly concerning three domains social functioning, communication and Stereotyped Behaviors.Diagnosis of autism requires significant amount of time and cost. ASD can be cause due to having an immediate family member whoâ€™s autistics, certain genetic mutations and some mental and physical health condition

        <center style="color: aliceblue;">Conclusion</center>
        <p>Our proposed model enables us to obtain a more precise outcome when it comes to early autism detection. In order to protect their privacy, the questions given to parents to determine whether or not their children are in danger are set up. Our suggested model can predict using SVM, Random Forest with 60%, 93% accuracy in the case of toddlers utilising the dataset from Q-CHAT. After preparing our dataset, supervised algorithms are chosen to run it. To improve the output, we applied SVM, Random Forest . When compared to the other results, this one demonstrated better performance. Our model's only drawback is a lack of sufficient huge data to train it.
